An application to catalogue books.
- JavaScript, Express JS, Sqlite, Sequalize.
- Storage is in a local SQLite database (fields = author, title)
- Functionality, the app will allow users to add, remove, list and search for books in the catalogue.

This App was created to help me learn/understand JavaScript, especially the interaction of client-side javaScript with server-side. This was also my first experience with the Sequalize module.
